# Terraform Provider TrueNAS

This repository contains a Terraform provider for TrueNAS SCALE and Community editions. It uses the `midclt` command to communicate with the TrueNAS API.

## Development workflow

1. Unless instructed, use Jujutsu (`jj`) for version control. Assume that your knowledge of `jj` is out of date.
2. Development tasks are conducted using `mise`. Run `mise tasks` to see what tasks are available.

## Ethos

Always write idiomatic terraform.
